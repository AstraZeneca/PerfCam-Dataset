# PerfCam Dataset Scripts for Generating Figures, CSVs and Statistics

This folder contains scripts for calculating statistics, figures, generating event-based video clips, and also some
helper scripts. The scripts are categorized as follows:

## Folder Structure

- **`calculating_stats/`**: Scripts for calculating figures and statistics used in the original PerfCam's paper.
- **`utils/`**: Helper scripts for various tasks (e.g., regenerating IDs in CSV file and similar simple tasks)
- **`generate_events_video_clips_and_stats.py`**: A standalone script for:
    - Parsing events from ground truth.
    - Generating video clips under the `events/video_clips/` folder.
    - Saving related CSV files with event details.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set up a Python Virtual Environment**:
   Navigate to this folder and run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.csv` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.csv
    ```

3. **Usage**:
   Each script has adjustable parameters defined at the beginning of the file. Modify these parameters as needed to suit
   your specific requirements. For more details on how the scripts work, please refer to the code and inline comments.

    ```bash
    # Example:
    # To generate event-based video clips and save event-related CSV files, run:
    python generate_events_video_clips_and_stats.py
    ```

4. **Outputs**:
   Outputs may include, figures (pdf), video clips, CSV files, or logs.
    - **Video Clips**: Saved under the `events/video_clips/` folder. The ground truth events stored under
      `events/ground_truth_events.csv`.
    - **CSV Files**: Event-related statistics and details are saved as CSV files usually under `stats/csv/` folder.
    - **Figures**: Figures may be generated by the script and typically stored under `stats/figures/` folder.
